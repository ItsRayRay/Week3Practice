# Week 3 Exercises 🚀📝

## 🚀 Exercise 1: Space Exploration Simulator 🌌
Create a class hierarchy for a space exploration simulator.

### Instructions:
1. Create a class called `SpaceShip` with the following properties:
   - `private String name`: The name of the spaceship. 🚀
   - `private final int maxCrew`: The maximum number of crew members the spaceship can accommodate. 👥
   - `private int currentCrew`: The current number of crew members on board. 👨‍🚀👩‍🚀
   - `private double fuelLevel`: The current fuel level of the spaceship. ⛽

2. Implement getter and setter methods for the `name`, `currentCrew`, and `fuelLevel` properties.

3. Create two constructors for the `SpaceShip` class:
   - A constructor that accepts the `name` and `maxCrew` as parameters and initializes the `currentCrew` and `fuelLevel` to 0.
   - A constructor that accepts the `name`, `maxCrew`, `currentCrew`, and `fuelLevel` as parameters.

4. Create a class called `CrewMember` with the following properties:
   - `private String name`: The name of the crew member. 😄
   - `private String role`: The role of the crew member (e.g., Captain, Engineer, Scientist). 👨‍✈️👩‍🔬

5. Implement getter and setter methods for the `name` and `role` properties of the `CrewMember` class.

6. In the `SpaceShip` class, add a method called `addCrewMember` that accepts a `CrewMember` object and adds it to the spaceship if there is available space. If the spaceship is full, print a message indicating that no more crew members can be added. 🚫

7. Create a `main` method to instantiate a `SpaceShip` object and add some `CrewMember` objects to it. Print the details of the spaceship and its crew members. 📜

## 🔷 Exercise 2: Shape Interfaces 🔷
Implement interfaces for different shapes and calculate their properties.

### Instructions:
1. Create an interface called `Shape` with the following methods:
   - `double calculateArea()`: Calculates the area of the shape. 📏
   - `double calculatePerimeter()`: Calculates the perimeter of the shape. 📐

2. Create a class called `Rectangle` that implements the `Shape` interface with the following properties:
   - `private double length`: The length of the rectangle. 📏
   - `private double width`: The width of the rectangle. 📏

3. Implement the `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()` methods in the `Rectangle` class according to the rectangle's formula. ➕🔢

4. Create a class called `Circle` that implements the `Shape` interface with the following property:
   - `private double radius`: The radius of the circle. 🔵

5. Implement the `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()` methods in the `Circle` class according to the circle's formula. 🔢➗

6. Create a `main` method to instantiate objects of the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes and calculate their areas and perimeters. 📊

## 🎵 Exercise 3: Playlist Analyzer 🎶
Implement algorithms to analyze a music playlist.

### Instructions:
1. Create a class called `PlaylistAnalyzer` with the following methods:
   - `public static String[] findLongSongs(String[] songs, double[] durations, double threshold)`: Accepts an array of song titles (`songs`) and an array of their corresponding durations (`durations`) in minutes. Returns an array containing the titles of the songs that exceed the given `threshold` duration. 🎵⏰

   - `public static double calculateTotalPlaytime(double[] durations)`: Accepts an array of song durations (`durations`) in minutes and calculates the total playtime of the playlist. ⏱️

2. Implement the `findLongSongs` method by iterating over the `songs` and `durations` arrays, comparing each song's duration with the `threshold`, and storing the titles of the songs that exceed the threshold in a new array. 🔍🎧

3. Implement the `calculateTotalPlaytime` method by iterating over the `durations` array and summing up all the durations. ➕⏰

4. Create a method called `public static void printSongs(String[] songs)` that accepts an array of song titles and prints them in a formatted manner. 🖨️🎶

5. In the `main` method, create an array of sample song titles and their corresponding durations. Call the `findLongSongs` method with a specific threshold value and store the result in a new array. Print the long songs using the `printSongs` method. Then, call the `calculateTotalPlaytime` method and print the total playtime of the playlist. ▶️🎵

## ☀️ Exercise 4: Array Manipulation ☀️
Implement algorithms to manipulate arrays in a weather data analysis system.

### Instructions:
1. Create a class called `WeatherDataAnalyzer` with the following method:
   - `public static double[] calculateAverageTemperature(double[][] temperatures)`: Accepts a 2D array of temperatures, where each row represents a day and each column represents an hour. Calculate and return an array containing the average temperature for each day. 🌡️📅

2. Implement the `calculateAverageTemperature` method by iterating over the 2D array, calculating the average temperature for each day, and storing the results in a new array. 🔢🌡️

3. Create a method called `public static void printTemperatures(double[] temperatures)` that accepts an array of temperatures and prints them in a formatted manner. 🖨️📊

4. In the `main` method, create a 2D array of sample temperature data and call the `calculateAverageTemperature` method. Then, print the results using the `printTemperatures` method. 📈
